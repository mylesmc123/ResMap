Assumed max depth or wse geojsons have already been processed.
    For westpark, geojsons were created via QGIS from exported max rasters from RAS Mapper. The steps: (https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/310076/qgis-dissolve-after-raster-to-polygon-not-working-correctly-only-dissolving-a)
        Polygonize
        Get Min Extent
        Clip Extent to Polygonized layer
        Simplify to 10'
        Feature to Json
        Copy Json to ./data

From the dissolved layer, we will use it as a boundary and then extract the RAS mesh output from the p## hdf to extract cell center data.

update hdf_paths.csv to point to associated max wse geojsons and their associated hdf plan file

batch_hdfs will use the csv file to produce shp's from the hdf that include all tooltip info and extract to tooltip geojsons (./data/{project_name}/tooltip_layers).

the script will also use ts_points.txt to produce a timeseries json (./data/{project_name}/timeseries/timeseries.json)
